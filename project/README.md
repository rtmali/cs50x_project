# Sudoku Game

Welcome to the Sudoku Game, a tribute to the timeless puzzle classic that many of us have turned to during our quiet moments—seeking both challenge and solace. This game, built using Python and Pygame, offers a digital escape into a world of numbers and logic, much like the penciled grids from newspapers and puzzle books that kept us company during quieter times, perhaps even hospital stays.

## Overview

This Sudoku Game allows you to solve randomly generated puzzles with varying difficulty levels, all within a user-friendly graphical interface. The game encapsulates the essence of Sudoku as we remember it—with features that enhance the experience, ensuring both veterans and newcomers can find enjoyment and challenge.

Inspiration for this project came from personal experiences; my own memory from days spent in a hospital ward. While battling a tumor, I found comfort in the structured calmness that Sudoku provided. Each number placed correctly on the grid was a small victory, a distraction, a reminder of normalcy amidst the chaos. I hope this game can offer a similar respite to you.

- **Reset and Renew**: Easily reset the game or switch to a new puzzle for a fresh start. Each new puzzle represents a new beginning, like turning over to a new page.
